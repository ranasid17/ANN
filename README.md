1) Repository containing various classes I created in order to better inform and predict stock market performance 
2) 8/2019: perceptron is a 1 layer perceptron that given an input matrix (X) and the correct output (Y), attempts 
    to predict whether the binary output should be [0,1] 
3) 10/22: twoDayChange is a class that given a CSV of historic data, calculates the relative price change of that 
    instrument's 48h performance (Monday-Wednesday of each week) and then plots a probability function of the 
    relative changes. Documentation within the class indicates how to pass arguments and interpret outputs of each 
    method. Each method should be used sequentially within class.
